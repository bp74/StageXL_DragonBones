##Runtime

This runtime started as a direct port of the original AS3 runtime for DragonBones.
Unfortunately the original runtime is quite complex and difficult to read. 
Therefore we decided to implement the DragonBones runtime for StageXL from scratch.
This should make it easier to maintain the runtime, fix bugs and add new features.
The drawback is that we don't support all the features of the original runtime yet.
Please open new issues with your favorite runtime feature we should add next.
